# The Personal IAAS 

Piaas is a set of tools that help you develop using multiple machines.
You can use your favorite IDE locally, while compile and serve on a more
powerful desktop PC remotely.

We all work on laptop today. However, compiling and serving on laptop
is crazy. The fan keeps working and creating quite a noise. Your battery
drained, cycle count increased. More than ever, peace of mind you lost.

Piaas help your workspace in sync with a remote machine, given it a 
more powerful desktop PC, a high end iMac or a shared server. Develop with
your favorite IDE, while compiling and serving from the desktop. Your 
laptop is relaxed to do the thing that absolutely required it to do.
**Great team work**, isn't it ? 

## Installation

Download the binary from the [github release page](https://github.com/sohoffice/piaas/releases/latest):

Extract and place the binary in your path and you're done.

## System requirements

The application support Mac OS, but was only tested on Mojave.

Linux should be fine, but untested.

On windows platform, WSL (windows subsystem linux) is required. At the
moment **Windows 10** is the only version with WSL so is the only version
supported.

If you need instructions on how to enable WSL on windows, check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
